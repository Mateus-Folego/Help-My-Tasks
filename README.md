<h2><strong>Status:</strong> Finished ✔️</h2>

### In this project I developed the "Help My Tasks". Help My Tasks is a task organizer. With it you can place your tasks and organize them according to your needs. This project was proposed in order to increase my knowledge of <strong>JSON</strong> and <strong>LocalStorage</strong> in JavaScript.
